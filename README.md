## Hi there, I'm Aarav! 👋

🚀 **Full-Stack Developer | API Whisperer | Optimization Fanatic** 🚀

I write code that even my future self can (sometimes) understand. Specializing in **Vue.js, Next.js, Django, and Go**, I create blazing-fast, scalable, and aesthetically pleasing web applications. If there's a way to shave milliseconds off load times, I'll find it. 🔍

- 💡 "Let's try a new framework!" – Me, every week.
- 🔍 Debugging is like detective work, but with more coffee and fewer crime scenes.
- 🎨 UX matters—users should feel like superheroes, not hostages.
